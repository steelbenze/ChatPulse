# MERN_Lets_Chat_App

<ul>
<li> The project I have created is a chat application that utilizes various technologies to enable real-time chatting functionality. The main components of the application are React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, MongoDB as the database, and socket.io for real-time communication. </li>
<li>Users can create accounts by signing up, providing their necessary details such as username, email, and password. They can then log in to the application using their credentials. Additionally, users have the ability to upload a profile photo, which can be viewed by other users.</li>
<li>The chat application supports both one-to-one and group chatting. In one-to-one chats, users can initiate conversations with other registered users. The real-time nature of socket.io allows for instant messaging and updates within the chat interface. Users can view the profiles of other users, providing information about them and their uploaded profile photos.</li>
